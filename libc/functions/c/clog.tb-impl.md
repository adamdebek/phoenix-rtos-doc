###Synopsis

`#include <complex.h>`

`double complex clog(double complex z);`
`float complex clogf(float complex z);`
`long double complex clogl(long double complex z);`

###Description
The functions calculate the complex natural logarithm of z, with a branch cut along the negative real axis. 

Arguments:
<u>z</u> - the complex number,

###Return value

The complex natural logarithm value, in the range of a strip mathematically unbounded along the real axis and in the interval [-i<span>&#960;</span>, +i<span>&#960;</span>] along the imaginary axis.

###Errors

No errors are defined.

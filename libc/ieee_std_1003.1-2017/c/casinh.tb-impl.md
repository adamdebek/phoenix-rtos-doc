###Synopsis

`#include <complex.h>`

`double complex casinh(double complex z);`
`float complex casinhf(float complex z);`
`long double complex casinhl(long double complex z);`

###Description

The functions compute the complex arc hyperbolic sine of <u>z</u>, with branch cuts outside the interval [`-i`, `+i`] along the imaginary axis.

Arguments
<u>z</u> - a complex number.
 
###Return value

These functions return the complex arc hyperbolic sine value, in the range of a strip mathematically unbounded along the real axis and in the interval [`-i`<span>&#960;</span>/2, +`+i`<span>&#960;</span>/2] along the imaginary axis.

###Errors

No errors are defined.
